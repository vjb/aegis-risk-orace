# 🛡️ AEGIS: THE SOVEREIGN DEFI FIREWALL (Chainlink 2026)

> **"Stopping Scams at the Smart Contract Level."**  
> *Track: Risk & Compliance / Artificial Intelligence*

## 🎬 The "Hollywood" Demo (Run in 2 mins)
We've packaged the entire protocol (Blockchain + Chainlink CRE + AI) into a single Docker container for easy verification.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop must be running.

```bash
# 1. Start the Docker Environment (The "World")
docker-compose up --build -d

# 2. Start the Aegis Protocol Stack (Frontend + Backend)
.\start-aegis.ps1

# 3. Run the Cinematic Verification Suite
node ./tests/hollywood-demo.js
```

### 🧪 End-to-End Verification (Advanced)
For judges who want to see the raw "metal" of the protocol, run the full 5-Phase System Audit (requires Anvil):

```bash
# Verify Anvil + Solidity + Chainlink Oracle
./tests/run-full-flow.ps1
```

### What you will see:
1. **Trusted Swap**: A safe trade cleansly passing the forensic audit.
2. **Protected Attack**: A malicious token being blocked and refunded autonomously.
3. **Preemptive Block**: **(NEW)** Automation detecting a threat and updating the cache *before* a user even trades.

## 💡 The Solution

### 🏛️ The Aegis Vault Architecture: "Escrow-First" Security

Traditional security tools suffer from the **"Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use" (TOCTOU)** vulnerability. By the time a user signs a transaction based on a "Safe" report, the market state may have changed (e.g., liquidity pulled, price crashed).

Aegis solves this by inverting the flow. We don't just advise; we enforce.

1.  **🔒 Lock (Escrow)**: The user/agent deposits funds into the `AegisVault`. State is frozen.
2.  **🕵️ Audit (Forensics)**: The Vault autonomously triggers the Chainlink CRE to perform a deterministic audit on the current block state.
3.  **⚡ Settlement (Atomic)**:
    *   **If Safe**: The Vault executes the swap and delivers the assets.
    *   **If Risk**: The Vault **REVERTS** the trade and refunds the original assets.

**The Result:** It is mathematically impossible to execute a trade that violates the safety policy. The code becomes the conscience.

## 👩‍⚖️ Judge's Guide: Where is the Chainlink?

Aegis uses the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** to create a "Triple Lock" security architecture.

| Feature | Implementation | File Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Sovereign Smart Escrow** | The `AegisVault.sol` contract locks funds and triggers the audit. | [AegisVault.sol](contracts/AegisVault.sol) |
| **2. Deterministic AI (Functions)** | The CRE Workflow that runs GPT-4o but enforces deterministic bitmasks. | [workflow.ts](aegis-workflow/src/workflow.ts) |
| **3. Preemptive Automation** | The `riskCache` mapping and `updateRiskCache` function for zero-latency blocking. | [AegisVault.sol:L35](contracts/AegisVault.sol#L35) |

## 💼 Real-World Use Cases & Business Value

Aegis acts as a **"Physics Engine"** for the Agent Economy, enabling use cases that were previously too risky to automate.

| Use Case | The Problem | The Aegis Solution | Business Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 Autonomous Betting Agents** | An AI agent with wallet access could hallucinate and drain funds on bad bets or scams. | **Permission Control**: The Agent can request trades, but only the Vault holds funds. The Vault blocks any trade that fails risk checks. | **"Sleep-at-Night" Security**: Developers can run autonomous bots 24/7 without risk of total wallet drain. |
| **🛡️ Copy-Trading Protection** | Influencers often dump tokens on followers ("Exit Liquidity"). A pre-check says "Safe," but the dump happens during the trade. | **Anti-Rug**: The Vault locks the buy-in. If the price crashes during the transaction block, the Oracle detects the anomaly and cancels the buy. | **Profit Preservation**: Users catch the upside of trends without becoming the victim of dumps. |
| **🏢 DAO Treasury Compliance** | Multisig signers might accidentally (or maliciously) send funds to sanctioned addresses (OFAC). | **Atomic Compliance**: The Vault physically refuses transfers to high-risk addresses (Tornado Cash, Sanctions Lists) as verified by the Oracle. | **Regulatory Safety**: Automates legal compliance at the smart contract level, protecting the DAO from liability. |
| **👶 Web3 Onboarding** | New users (or children) don't understand "Honeypots" or "Fake Collections" and ignore UI warnings. | **Safe-Fail Environment**: The Vault acts as a "Smart Wallet" that rejects interactions with unverified contracts. | **User Retention**: Prevents the "I lost everything on day 1" experience that drives users away from DeFi. |

## 🛡️ The Triple Lock Architecture

Aegis is not just a chatbot. It is a **Smart Escrow Protocol** that enforces safety via code.

### Phase 1: The Lock (Smart Contract)
User calls `swap()`. The Vault **locks keys in escrow** and dispatches a job to the Chainlink DON. The user *cannot* lose funds to a scam because the funds never leave the vault until safety is proven.

### Phase 2: The Audit (Chainlink CRE)
The DON executes a **"Split-Brain" Workflow**:
- **Right Brain (AI)**: `GPT-4o` scans for fuzzy risks (Sentiment, Dev History).
- **Left Brain (Logic)**: Enforces a strict, deterministic schema.

### Phase 3: The Verdict (Consensus)
Nodes must reach consensus on the **Risk Bitmask**.
- **Risk 0**: `fulfillRequest` unlocks the funds.
- **Risk > 0**: `fulfillRequest` refunds the user autonomously.

## 🕸️ The Risk Bitmask Protocol (LLM on Rails)

We force the AI to output specific bit flags. This ensures **determinism** across oracle nodes.

| **Bit** | **Value** | **Category** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `1` | Liquidity | Low Liquidity (<$50k) |
| 1 | `2` | Volatility | High Volatility Spill |
| 2 | `4` | Security | Malicious Code Patterns |
| 3 | `8` | Governance | Renounced Ownership |
| 4 | `16` | Scam | Honeypot Trap Detected |

| **Bit** | **Value** | **Category** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | `32` | Identity | Impersonation Attempt |
| 6 | `64` | Pattern | Wash Trading Detected |
| 7 | `128` | History | Suspicious Deployer |
| 8 | `256` | Metadata | Phishing Signature |
| 9 | `512` | Anomaly | AI Anomaly Detection |
